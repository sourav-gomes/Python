# Tuples --> Main diff b/w Lists & Tuples is that you cannot update Tuples

t=(7,2,5,2,88,0, 2,2)

print(t.count(2))       # Returns no of times the values occurs eg. 2 occurs 4 times in this case
print(t.index(88))      # Returns first index of the value, in this case 88 occurs first in the 4th index
